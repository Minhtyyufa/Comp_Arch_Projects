# Project 1
This program prompts the user for two strings, concatenates them, and prints the result. 
If the first input string is over 10 characters, the program will exit with code 21.
If the second input string is over 10 characters, the program will exit with code 22.
Otherwise, the program will output the concatenated string and will exit with the character count.

To compile and run the program, run these commands:
    make clean
    make
    ./project1

The program will then prompt the user for the first string by displaying the message:
    Input first string: 
This is where the user should input their first string

The program will then prompt the user for the second string by displaying the message:
    Input second string:
This is where the user should input their second string

If no errors are thrown, the program will output:
    The concatenated string is: [concatenated string]
